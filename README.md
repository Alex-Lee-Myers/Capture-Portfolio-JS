# Capture | Portfolio Site

### [Capture-portfolio-alm.netlify.app]

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

"Capture" is a responsive, eye-catching, React-powered portfolio site built specifically as a playground for learning Framer-Motion animations and as a baseline for reusable components. This is the first step of many in rebuilding from scratch an old team project I did with my bootcamp Elevent Fifty Academy called [GameChest][gc]; I hope to rebuild this PERN application with much more depth taken to its frontend design.

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

## Technologies

- [Framer-Motion]
- [Netlify]
- [React]
- [React-Intersection-Observer]
- [React-Router-Dom-V6]
- [Styled-Components]
